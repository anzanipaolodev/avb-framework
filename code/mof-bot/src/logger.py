    A singleton class for logging events asynchronously, providing a centralized
    way to record actions, messages, and errors across different modules. The class
    maintains a background event loop in a separate thread for non-blocking, concurrent logging.
    Attributes:
    ----------
    console : Console
        A Rich console instance used for colorized output to the terminal.
    log_file : str
        Path to the file where log messages will be saved.
    lock : Lock
        An asyncio lock to ensure only one write operation occurs at a time.
    loop : AbstractEventLoop
        The background event loop dedicated to logging tasks.
    initialized : bool
        A flag to check if the singleton has already been initialized.
    _instance : EventLogger or None
        Holds the singleton instance of EventLogger.
