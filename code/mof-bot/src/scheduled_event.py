class ScheduledEvent:
    """
    Represents a scheduled event with timing, content, and backoff properties
    for autonomous execution with retry mechanisms.
    Attributes:
    ----------
    event_time : datetime
        The scheduled time for the event to be executed.
    description : str
        A brief description of the event's purpose.
    completed : bool
        Status of event completion; True if completed, False otherwise.
    content : str or None
        Holds content related to the event (e.g., tweet text), set when generated.
    backoff_time : int
        The time in minutes to wait before retrying the event on failure. Initially set to 0,
        but adjusts dynamically based on retry attempts.
    Methods:
    -------
    apply_backoff():
        Applies an exponential backoff strategy by doubling the backoff time and rescheduling 
        `event_time` accordingly.

        Parameters:
        ----------
        event_time : datetime
            The time when the event is initially scheduled to occur.
        description : str, optional
            A short description of the event (default is an empty string).
        backoff_time : int, optional
            Initial time in minutes to delay retries if the event fails (default is 0).
        logger : EventLogger, optional
            An instance of EventLogger to handle logging; if not provided, logging will be skipped.
