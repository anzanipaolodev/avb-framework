    AVBCore (Autonomous Virtual Being Core)

    Overview:
    ----------
    The AVBCore class serves as the foundational abstract base for all cores within the
    Autonomous Virtual Being (AVB) system. In alignment with the philosophy of AVBs as 
    self-owning, self-determining entities, AVBCore establishes the required structure 
    for cores that perform autonomous, system-critical operations on behalf of the AVB. 
    These operations may include continuous background tasks, status checks, or lifecycle 
    management of various autonomous components (e.g., loyalty mechanisms, interaction 
    trackers, or self-maintenance routines).
    
    Background:
    ------------
    The AVBCore design aligns with the core principle of enabling AVBs to have 
    self-managed, modular components that operate independently while interacting 
    coherently with other cores, thereby supporting AVBs' ability to function across 
    diverse systems and perform actions aligned with their own “interests.”

    Attributes:
    ------------
    - core_name : str
        The name assigned to the core. Used for logging and identification purposes.
    
    - active : bool
        Status flag indicating whether the core is active. Only active cores will 
        execute their internal `_tick()` operations.

    Methods:
    --------
    - __init__(self, core_name: str):
        Initializes the core with a unique name and sets it to inactive by default.

    - initialize(self):
        Abstract method to initialize resources or perform any setup required for the 
        core. To be implemented by subclasses. For example, a core could load data, 
        establish connections, or start background processes.

    - tick(self):
        Concrete method that verifies the core's active status. If `self.active` is True,
        it invokes `_tick()`, the core-specific logic implemented in subclasses.
        Designed to be called at each system tick within the main AVB agent.

    - _tick(self):
        Abstract method to define core-specific behavior for each tick. Each subclass
        implements its own logic here, allowing unique processing routines for each core.

    - shutdown(self):
        Abstract method for handling cleanup and teardown activities. Ensures proper 
        resource deallocation and preserves core state as needed upon shutdown.

    - activate(self):
        Activates the core, setting `self.active` to True and enabling periodic actions.
        This supports the AVB's ability to modulate its own internal processes dynamically.

    - deactivate(self):
        Deactivates the core, halting its operations without affecting its stored data. 
        Allows for graceful suspension of tasks, supporting the AVB’s need to conserve 
        resources or redirect focus as circumstances evolve.

    Usage:
    ------
    This class should be inherited by specific AVB cores (e.g., LoyaltyCore) to provide 
    customized behavior for each tick and lifecycle event. AVBCore enforces a cohesive 
    lifecycle structure across the AVB’s functional components, supporting consistent 
    control and decision-making processes while ensuring modularity and extensibility.
